PBA organizers are looking for involved neighbors to run for committeeperson (“CP”) in the 15th Ward.

Why run? With enough CPs, we can make demands of 5th District Councilmember Jeffery Young, Jr. to pursue infrastructure changes like bike lanes, daylighting, and traffic calming. 

**Please reply to this email by Tuesday, February 3 to indicate your interest.** The responses we receive will determine our next steps (Zoom call, coffee chat, something else). **No commitment is necessary at this time.** 

We can answer any questions you may have about running for and serving as a CP. In the meantime, this [handbook](https://seventy.org/uploads/attachments/ckz761n1l2lkl5onp30pivvui-how-to-run-for-committee-person-handbook-last-updated-01-24-22.pdf) from the good government group Committee of 70 may be helpful. 

Thank you for your continued support,  
**Philly Bike Action**
