**Greetings District 3\! Here is our meeting recap from Monday, February 9\. Lots of action items (many with approaching deadlines) for anyone who’d like to get involved\!** 

**West Market Street Safety Campaign:🦺**

* The stretch of Market St. around Penn and Drexel, westward to 46th St., is very wide, encouraging dangerous driving. Two pedestrians were killed on Penn/Drexel campuses by drivers last November.  
* The petition is OPEN. If you haven’t signed, please do so.  
  https://bikeaction.org/campaigns/west-market-street/  
* If you’ve already signed, please pass this on to people you know\!  
* We are also looking for volunteers for canvassing efforts between now and February 20\. If you are interested, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqnJy9oQqBYgKKchWPCMONhYsHh4JN3MvbmPjiGphynsyU6g/viewform) ASAP.  
* More discussion on \#west-market-st Discord channel.

**Snow in the Bike Lanes ❄️**

* PBA has posted on social media around the continued inaccessibility of the city to cyclists, pedestrians, and transit riders following the snow storm.  
* Even when much of the snow is gone, massive snow piles in the bike lane will remain.  
* D3 folks are organizing to come together and capture some fun pictures/video of one of the remaining snow piles. Exact place and date TBA. More to come on the D3 Discord channel.  
* Reach out to Claudia and Andre (@claud2424 and @doop\_city) on Discord for more details. 

**48th and Woodland Safety Improvements (connection to Grays Ferry Bridge)🌉**

* The City of Philadelphia is gathering feedback around traffic safety in the neighborhood surrounding the 48th & Woodland playground \- home to the very dangerous entrance to the Grey’s Ferry Bridge, a key cycling corridor.  
* There is an online survey open through February 15\. It’s especially important to give feedback if you live or frequently travel through this area.  
* Please encourage anyone you know who utilizes the area to complete the survey. This might be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve infrastructure in the area.

**Low Traffic Pilot 🚸**

* Roy is exploring the idea of getting the city/Jamie Gauthier onboard with a low traffic fix on one of the small streets here in West.  
* Current candidates include Willows Ave in front of Carbon Copy and the slip lane on 46th & Baltimore. These streets could be open to foot traffic, plants, etc.
