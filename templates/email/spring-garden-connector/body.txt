The proposed project includes many excellent safety improvements, including:

* East-west **concrete protected bike lanes** on Spring Garden St from Delaware Ave. to Pennsylvania Ave  
* Shorter pedestrian crossings across Spring Garden  
* Narrower vehicular lanes


These improvements are great, but we can do even better\! **Attend the open house and leave feedback supporting the following additional improvements**:

* Traffic calming that lowers speeds to an average of 25 mph  
* Shorten ALL pedestrian crossings with curb extensions  
* Leading intervals for pedestrians  
* Bike signals  
* A 5 to 3 lane reduction (road diet)

Drop by the open house, **Wednesday November 19**,  any time between 5 and 8 pm to find out more about the project and to leave comments about how to make it even safer for cyclists and pedestrians.
